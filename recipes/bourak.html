    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Bourek is a delicious Algerian appetizer that can be filled with meat,potatoes, cheese or whatever you want , 
        all of the options are delicious! Normally, we would serve this alongside tomato soupe, 
        but They also make the perfect late night snack if you ask me! Yes
        , these are fried, but you can totally take the healthier route when making these by baking them in the oven instead</p>
